    "## 1. Introduction to the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Work-life balance is no longer a new concept to the society, however remains a heated debate. To some, work-life balance means the convenience of being able to manage a personal life during the work day, without the hassle of having to get permission or explain our activities to others. Another common definition of this is \"equal time or priority to personal and professional activities\" (Forbes, 2022). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in a developing country like Vietnam, this issue has not received much attention from individuals as well as businesses until recently. In fact, work-life balance is the most vital factor for Vietnamese candidates looking for jobs in 2022, according to the latest report from comprehensive human resources management solutions company - Grove HR and data analysis company - YouGov (UK). Young people are increasingly aware of and prioritize this issue more than ever, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this debated issue, a dataset sourced from Kaggle has been chosen and visualized into a dashboard for further research and awareness. Following the CAST Template from “Stories that Move Mountains” by Sykes, Malik and West (2012), this project will carefully assess (a) the quality, completeness of the dataset, (b) the quality of the dashboard, (c) the relevance of the dataset and its potential contribution to the issue and (d) the analytics tools and methods as well.

    "## 2. Content of the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors from the “Stories that Move Mountains” has developed the Visual Story Map: (C)ontent, (A)udience, (S)tory and (T)ell. The content should have 4 points: Why, What, How and What if.\n",
    "\n",
    "***2.1. Why?***\n",
    "These days, young generation struggle to balance their work and life. Some put in excessive amounts of time and energy to advance their careers. Some begin their pursuit of pleasure and comfort at a very young age. A combination of perfectionism, company culture, and demanding jobs causes poor work-life balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is almost impossible to achieve work-life balance for a variety of reasons. Overwhelming work/family duties are the most common example. Or someone tries to put in more hours in an effort to get promoted or get paid more. Having children also turn their lives upside down, especially women. All lead to an imbalance and intensify in severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "***2.2. What?***\n",
    "Indeed, a healthy employee work-life balance drives engagement, productivity, and retention, which is why greater awareness of the definition and harmful effects of work-life imbalance needs to be more widespread, especially in Vietnam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Companies in Vietnam need to pay closer attention to the psychological, physical, and mental health issues of their employees with different strategies such as providing emotional support, expanding benefits, and subsidizing physical activities. Accordingly, the company will also attract more candidates during the recruitment process, as 57% of workers say a poor work-life balance is a drawback when seeking for new workplace. So, what are the in-deep factors that need the most attention?\n",
    "\n",
    "***2.3. How and What if?***\n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected that companies and workers in Vietnam would have a more realistic view of the issue of work-life balance and innovate their mindset, as well as encourage firms to make a change in their working environment. In the end, this is the benefit for Vietnamese companies as well, simplifying the recruitment process and having a step forward compared to their rivals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a dashboard using survey data from 15,972 respondents with 22 factors describing how people should live their lives to come up with the Work-Life Balance Score. The purpose of this project, using the dataset as reference is aiming at enhancing life quality of Vietnamese people, making one step closer towards the global development, following United Nations' 17 Development Goals:\n",
    "- 8.4: Improve progressively, through 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavor to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation, in accordance with the 10-Year Framework of Programs on Sustainable Consumption and Production, with developed countries taking the lead;\n",
    "- 12.8: By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature;\n",
    "- 12.8.1: Extent to which (i) global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable development (including climate change education) are mainstreamed in (a) national education policies; (b) curricula; (c) teacher education; and (d) student assessment."

    "Data visualization is representing data into graphic forms such as graphs, charts or using different methods and tools to best visualize and illustrate data. In general, the core purpose of creating a visualization dashboard in order to approach as many audiences as possible. A dashboard is the most general model of a specific problem, helping viewers have a more holistic perspective of that problem. Specifically, an effective dashboard is required to have an eye-catching and easy-to-read design that takes little time for the readers to learn about the issue in question, meanwhile, it must be done with thorough and honest research and persuasive purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, proper data visualization techniques will help us gain more insight into the reality of work-life balance. While traditional methods do not work effectively with large amounts of data since it would be extremely difficult and time-consuming to find certain data among the giant data spreadsheets. Not to mention, this data will not help analysts see an overview of the problems. Especially while managers need to track many specific indicators to set target strategies to improve the working environment in the long term.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the Work-Life Balance Dashboard, using Set 2 colors, contains two doughnut charts, three textboxes, one bar chart and one tree map. These types of charts, to some extent, are commonly used and evaluated as suitable for describing the differences and the percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Set 2 color palette in Python is designed to have a set of distinct and easily distinguishable colors, which is for categorical data. This is particularly useful when we are visualizing data with multiple categories or groups, as it helps in preventing confusion among different elements in the graph. It is carefully chosen to be visually appealing and work well together. This can enhance the overall look of your visualizations, making them more engaging and professional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, three textboxes on the left side give a general information about the dataset. Meanwhile, the first doughnut chart represents the percentage of people suffering from stress daily ranked by level 0 to 5.  Beside is the similar chart type showing the percentage of men and women having daily stress. These two charts show the fact about what people are facing when they imbalance their lives. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bar chart illustrates the average rank of age groups for each variable. With an excessive number of values, it is a better choice to use the mean of this variable for comparison purpose to avoid confusion.  On the other hand, the tree map demonstrates the percentage of work-life balance score by age group or gender. There are drop-down options for users to select, which creates a chance to include several charts with same purpose in only a corner of the dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Significantly, it is expected that when being given this dashboard to managers and above or simply an employee for making decision, they will look at the three textboxes on the left to have an overview of the project, as well as its objectivity. Then to look at the two doughnut charts showing the seriousness of people’s mental issues due to several reasons. Observing the bar chart underneath, people can see the list of concerns by clicking on the box option. Therefore, they can see the difference and summarize which point to be focused on and decide their strategies or organize wellness programs in improving each quality of life. Finally, the tree map is the final targeted Work-Life Balance Score, implying that the segmentation of low Work-life balance score by age group or gender should be innovated by proper solutions. \n"

    "\n",
    "**6.1. Python as a programming language**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is the chosen language during this Dashboard creation process, which brings both advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mentioning the advantages, Python is an appropriate language for analysts, including beginners. Pandas, Plotly Express and Dash bootstrap components libraries are used in terms of processing data for this dashboard. These are evaluated as highly customisable and suitable for complex visualisations and ideal for automation and embedding in web applications as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, Pandas is a Python library that provides fast, powerful, flexible data structures. Pandas is designed to work easily and intuitively with structured (tabular, multidimensional, heterogeneous) and time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the interactivity that Plotly makes charts more intuitive and interesting. Not only that, Plotly is timesaving, easy to use, and combines well with other Python libraries like Pandas. This would be a great choice for creating interactive charts and high-quality graphs in statistical processing. When moving the mouse to the charts, the prcoessed data is displayed in detail, helping viewers easily learn and analyze the overview, avoiding wasting time calculating and analyzing the color of each variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dash bootstrap components is an extension library for Dash, designed to integrate Bootstrap components into Dash applications to enhance the user interface. Dash also offers the external website to ensure a logically structured user interface.\n",
    "Overall, the loading speed and response time when creating this Work-Life Balance Dashboard is assessed to be fast while being capable of handling this massive dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Drawbacks:\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, there are some limitations in using Python for this project. Creating a visualization dashboard requires a variety in design and color palettes. However, there are only a few sets of colors and the design format, somehow fixed and not diversified, limiting the creators’creativity and decrease the users’ interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6.2. Limitations of the Project and Possible Solutions**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is believed that the absence of the following limitations would have further enhanced the quality of the visualization dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, while the dataset was usable and instrumental for the dashboard, it was not implemented in Vietnam, therefore, the variables might not be perfectly applicable to Vietnamese people according to cultures or lifestyles. In fact, there are almost no surveys related to this topic taken in Vietnam (there were only a small number of respondents and no updating time period, beside, there are not many categorises in the survey). This would lead to the lack of reality and decrease the persuasiveness of the dashboard. It is highly recommended that in the near future, there would be a survey organized on a large scale in Vietnam, delving into the unique factors directly affecting the work-life imbalance of Vietnamese people, bringing insight to the managerial boards for decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, English is not the mother tongue language of Vietnam. This would create a barrier to the readers. With the aim of approaching numerous workers in Vietnam, this dashboard should have a Vietnamese version for further reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, as mentioned, Python is known for a common programming language and probably appropriate for this project. Nevertheless, due to its limitations in designing variety, in the long run, other tools such as Tableau, Power BI, ... should be widely applied so as to diversify the design of the dashboard, enhancing the quality and before presenting to the audience. \n"

    "## 7. Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, this Work-Life Balance Dashboard project, overall, has probably given out the holistic \n",
    "overview of several life quality values to be paid great attention sourced from a survey on a large scale by utilizing the chosen data. In addition, through research on users’ awareness, the author has tried to enhance the users’ experience with a selection of graph design and drop-down boxes. Although there are some limitations as mentioned above, it is expected that their possible solutions are addressed to create a well-developed and creative dashboard in the future, which is supposed to be more applicable and realistic in Vietnam – a developing country.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, this dashboard is created based on the urgent need of not only Vietnamese companies but also global firms for the purpose of organizing a positive work and life experience. Actively limit overtime work; overtime pay; health and mental care; Flexible work plans such as part-time work; work from home; Flexible clock in and out times; employee and family support; health insurance for employees; mandatory vacation; sick leave; Bonus days off based on seniority... These are the criteria that labor experts have compiled, with the desire to incorporate work-life balance policies into management policies to minimize pressures in the workplace. By doing so, both workers and businesses will earn benefit.\n"
